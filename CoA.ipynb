      "\n",
      "SIGNIFICANT OBSERVATIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "Favorable Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worthy to mention that for CY 2014, the Municipality of Banna was a recipient of the Environmental Compliance Certificate (ECC) for the Sanitary Landfill by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) through the Environmental Management Bureau, Region I issued under Presidential Decree 1586. Also, the agency garnered the 2014 Good Financial Housekeeping and excellence in Kalusugan Pangkalahatan Award Municipal Category National.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tLikewise, the municipal government has been complying consistently in the withholding of taxes in accordance with Revenue Regulation No. 2-98 dated April 17, 1998 and the same were remitted within the reglementary period.\n",
      "\n",
      "5% LOCAL DISASTER RISK REDUCTION AND MANAGEMENT FUND (LDRRMF) – \n",
      "\n",
      "The amount budgeted for the year for the local calamity fund amounted to Php 2,690,065.95 of which the amount of Php2,460,365.95 was spent for relief  goods, conduct of trainings pertaining to basic life support, Dengue prevention program and   purchase of medicines distributed to constituents during the Saranay to Barangay Program.  Likewise, it was spent for the mobilization of task unit for disaster operation and emergency response.\n",

      "\tThe Municipality appropriated 5 % for its Gender and Development Fund.  The amount was spent for GAD related activities such as education and human resource development, health, nutrition and family planning, heed for supplemental feeding for identified under nourished children,  need to intensify information campaign on sexual and reproductive health program to both men and women and trainings on family planning for BHWs.

Similarly, the fund was used for environment and natural resources in support to solid waste management and   clean and green program of the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, some transactions which need to be corrected or improved are enumerated in the herein audit observations with its corresponding recommendations, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)  in  the amount of  P235,806,061.31 as of December 31, 2014 could not be ascertained due to non   submission of the     inventory report    and the absence of  subsidiary ledgers,  contrary to Section 13 of NGAS Manual.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have reiterated our recommendation that the Property Custodian  submit the required inventory report which is very much long overdue.  Require the Accounting personnel concerned to regularly prepare lapsing schedule of all PPE accounts and to maintain the required records and reports in the acquisition of additional assets which are necessary in the reconciliation of the PPE account.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Construction in Progress  of P 146,164,293.78 represents   completed  infrastructure projects which were not yet transferred to the Registry of Public Infrastructure, thus the asset and government equity accounts were overstated by the same amount  contrary to Section 4 (n) of the NGAS Manual for local government units.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "We have recommended that the Accounting Office and the Designated Property Custodian  exert effort to identify the completed projects under the Construction in Progress account and close  the same to Public Infrastructure account.  Further, at the end of the year, close the Public Infrastructure account to Government Equity to eliminate the overstatement of PPE account.  Conversely, a Registry of Public Infrastructure should be maintained for the transfer of Infrastructure projects already closed to Government Equity account but are intended for public use, such as roads, bridges and highways among others.  Henceforth, compliance with Section 4 (n) of the NGAS Manual should be observed and adhered to so as to present the true financial condition of the agency. \n",
      "\n",
      "3.The accuracy and existence of the balance of the Cash in Bank-LCC account of    P39, 226,742.44 is doubtful due to non-preparation of Bank Reconciliation Statements (BRS) of the municipality.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have recommended that the Municipal Accountant prepare and update the bank reconciliation statements of the municipality in order to have an accurate presentation of the cash in bank accounts in the financial statements\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The inspection of deliveries of supplies and materials, equipment and services were not conducted by the inspectorate team   which is not in accordance with Section 27 of Presidential Decree 898 and the basic principle of a strong internal control system pertaining to Property and Supply Management in the Local Government Units.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have recommended that management  create  an Inspectorate Team to inspect procured supplies and materials, equipment and services including raw materials and components to determine their conformity with the contract requirements including all applicable drawings, specifications and  purchase description. \n",
      "\n",
      "5.

      "6. The Municipality granted Productivity Enhancement Incentive (PEI) to officials and employees exceeding the maximum allowable amount of P5,000.00 or a total of            P1,274,000.00 which is not in compliance with Section 1 (a) of Executive Order (E.O.) No. 80 s. 2012 thus, disallowed in audit.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have  recommended that concerned officials and employees  refund/return to the coffers of the municipality  the excess amount of Productivity Enhancement Incentive (PEI)  totaling P  1,274,000.00 as required under Executive Order (E.O.) No. 80. The amount could be used as an additional fund of the municipality to finance its operations.\n",

Conversely,  a Registry of Public Infrastructure should be maintained for transfer of Infrastructure projects already closed to Government Equity account but  are intended for public use, such as roads, bridges and highways among others.
